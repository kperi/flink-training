This guide describes how to setup an environment to locally develop, debug, and execute Flink programs. Flink supports Linux, OS X, and Windows as development environments for Flink programs and local execution. 

### 1. Software requirements

Make sure you have installed the following software on your system.

- Java JDK 7 (or 8)
- Scala 2.10 (Scala 2.11 not supported out-of-the-box)
- Apache Maven 3.x
- Git
- an IDE for Java (and/or Scala) development (follow these [instructions](http://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/internals/ide_setup.html) to set up IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)

### 2. Generate a Flink Maven project

Flink provides Maven archetypes to correctly setup Maven projects for Java or Scala Flink programs. Run one of following commands to generated a Flink Java or Scala project.

**Flink Java Project**

~~~bash
mvn archetype:generate                             \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.flink            \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=flink-quickstart-java    \
    -DarchetypeVersion=0.9-SNAPSHOT                \
    -DgroupId=org.apache.flink.quickstart          \
  	-DartifactId=flink-java-project                \
  	-Dversion=0.1                                  \
  	-Dpackage=org.apache.flink.quickstart          \
  	-DinteractiveMode=false
~~~

**Flink Scala project**

~~~bash
mvn archetype:generate                             \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.flink            \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=flink-quickstart-scala   \
    -DarchetypeVersion=0.9-SNAPSHOT                \
    -DgroupId=org.apache.flink.quickstart          \
  	-DartifactId=flink-scala-project               \
  	-Dversion=0.1                                  \
  	-Dpackage=org.apache.flink.quickstart          \
  	-DinteractiveMode=false
~~~

The generate projects are located in a folder called `flink-java-project` or `flink-scala-project`.

### 3. Import the Flink Maven project into your IDE

The generated Maven project needs to be imported into your IDE:

- IntelliJ: 
  1. Select *"File"* -> *"Import Project"*
  1. Select root folder of your project
  1. Select *"Import project from external model"*, select *"Maven"* 
  1. Leave default options and finish the import
- Eclipse: 
  1. Select *"File"* -> *"Import"* -> *"Maven"* -> *"Existing Maven Project"*
  1. Follow the import instructions

### 4. Execute and debug a Flink program in an IDE

Flink programs can be executed and debugged from within an IDE. This significantly eases the development process and gives a programming experience similar to working on a regular Java application. Starting a Flink program in your IDE is as easy as starting its `main()` method. Under the hood, the `ExecutionEnvironment` will start a local Flink instance within the execution process. Hence it is also possible to put brakepoints everywhere in your code and debug it.

Assuming you have an IDE with a Flink quickstart project imported, you can execute and debug the example `WordCount` program which is included in the quickstart project as follows:

- Open the `org.apache.flink.quickstart.WordCount` class in your IDE
- Place a break point somewhere in the `flatMap()` method of the `LineSplitter` class which is inlined defined in the `WordCount` class.
- Execute or debug the `main()` method of the `WordCount` class using your IDE.

### 5. Install Flink for local execution

In order to execute program on a running Flink instance (and not from within your IDE) you need to install Flink on your machine. To do so, follow these steps:

- Download a Flink 0.9-SNAPSHOT build of Apache Flink. The latest build can be downloaded [here](http://stratosphere-bin.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/flink-0.9-SNAPSHOT-bin-hadoop2.tgz).
- Extract the downloaded `.tgz` archive
- The resulting folder contains a Flink setup that can be locally executed without any further configuration.

### 6. Start a local Flink instance

Given that you have a local Flink installation, you can start a Flink instance that runs a master and a worker process on your local machine in a single JVM. This execution mode is useful for local testing. 

#### Start local Flink instance

On UNIX system you can start a Flink instance as follows:

~~~bash
cd /to/your/flink/installation
./bin/start-local.sh
~~~

On Windows you have to run the following commands

~~~bash
cd C:\to\your\flink\installation
.\bin\start-local.bat
~~~

#### Validate that Flink is running

You can validate that a local Flink instance is running by looking at the log files in `./log/` or opening the JobManager's webinterface at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). 

#### Stop local Flink instance

On UNIX you call 

~~~bash
./bin/stop-local.sh
~~~

On Windows you quit the running process with `Ctrl-C`.
